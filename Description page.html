            <strong><h1 class="pb-4 mb-4 fst-italic border-bottom">Description</h1></strong>



            <p style="font-size:160%;">Luffy is usually recognizable by his straw hat, a gift from "Red-Haired" Shanks. In his early childhood, he also wears a white shirt and blue shorts. Luffy also has a scar under his left eye from stabbing himself to demonstrate his courage to Shanks and his crew. He later wears a red vest, denim shorts, and sandals, before replacing his vest with a red, unbuttoned sea captain's coat (revealing the X-shaped scar on his chest he received from Akainu), and a yellow sash tied around his waist. Concerning his ethnicity, Oda revealed that he imagines Luffy to be of Brazilian descent, albeit in a real-world context.</p>

            <br>

            <h1 class="pb-4 mb-4 fst-italic border-bottom"><strong>Personality</strong></h1>


            <p style="font-size:160%;">Luffy is portrayed as a carefree, fun loving, happy-go-lucky character with great ambition and a huge appetite, often thinking with his stomach and comically gorging himself. He is also optimistic and generally good-hearted, he is not as dimwitted as many believe him to be, and he often demonstrates more understanding than the other characters expect.</p>

            <img src="https://static.displate.com/280x392/displate/2021-02-23/643f87c11b996882e1c1e93b6ee02079_400f9f8541ac782a9d21214d9bcd8115.jpg" alt="Luffy" style="float:right;width:280px;height:392px;padding:10px;">

            <p style="font-size:160%;">Knowing the danger ahead, Luffy is willing to risk his life to become. King of the Pirates and protect his crew. A capable and reliable captain, he never puts his crew or himself at risk out of incompetence. During the Loguetown story arc, Smoker (a navy captain at the time) says that Luffy "enjoys playing stupid"; Luffy responds to him with a mysterious smile.</p>

            <p style="font-size:160%;">He always sees the bright side of situations, or anything that goes wrong, and takes matters with a smile and an upbeat nature. He even enjoyed having people join his crew as Luffy was eager to accept Sanji's bride-to-be as part of his crew but only if Sanji returned himself.</p>





            <strong><h1 class="pb-4 mb-4 fst-italic border-bottom">Crew Selection</h1></strong>

            <p style="font-size:160%;"><img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Straw-Hat-Crew-Pirates-of-One-Piece-Featured-Image.png?q=50&fit=crop&w=943&h=500&dpr=1.5" alt="GUM GUM Pistol" style="float:left;width:602px;height:338px;padding:10px;">He enlists Chopper and Brook for his crew not just for their personality or appearance, but also because of his instinctive ability to read people. Luffy needs key jobs filled by his crew to be a successful pirate captain(cook, navigator, medic, musician, and quartermaster, filled by Sanji, Nami, Chopper, Brook, and Franky, respectively).</p> 
                
            <p style="font-size:160%;">At the beginning of the series, he said that he wanted at least ten crew members with abilities he felt necessary for his goal. Despite his carefree personality, each crew member respects him in their own way.</p>

            <p style="font-size:160%;">Luffy is rarely concerned about the consequences of his actions, doing what he feels is right in the moment, even if it leads to retaliation by a powerful force. He is an extremely loyal captain, who has demonstrated throughout the series that he is willing to risk his life for the well-being of his crew.</p>



            <br>

            <div class="clearfix">

                <h1 style="text-align:left;" class= "pb-4 mb-4 fst-italic border-bottom"><strong>Abilities</strong></h1>


                <p style="font-size:160%;"><img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Luffy-Gomu-Gomu-Feature.jpg" alt="Devil Fruit" style="float:right;width:602px;height:338px;padding:10px;">Luffy's rubberiness is a result of eating a Devil Fruit called the Gum-Gum Fruit, which makes him immune to electric attacks and most blunt force truama, also giving him the ability to stretch his body at will. He uses his elasticity to accelerate parts or all of his body to deliver faster punches, kicks, head butts, and body movements or for propulsion. Like others exposed to Devil. Fruit, Luffy cannot swim; when he is submerged in water or when he makes contact with a material called the Sea-Prism Stone, when in contact he loses his strength and cannot move on his own. In addition to his Devil Fruit powers, he has immense strength.</p>

                <br>

                <h1 class="pb-4 mb-4 fst-italic border-bottom"><strong>Signature Moves</strong></h1>

                <p style="font-size:160%;"><img src="http://opwiki.org/images/Gum-gum-jet-pistol.jpg" alt="GUM GUM Pistol" style="float:right;width:602px;height:338px;padding:10px;">Luffy's signature attack is the Gum-Gum Pistol (ゴムゴムの銃ピストル, Gomu Gomu no Pisutoru), a punch which he learned during years of training. Another technique developed later in the series is Second Gear (ギア2セカンド, Gia Sekando), which increases his strength and speed for a short time but strains his body and can shorten his lifespan if used too long.</p> 
                    
                <p style="font-size:160%;">Observing CP9's Shave (剃, Soru) technique, Luffy adapts the move to his rubber body and matches the assassins speed. Third Gear (ギア3サード, Gia Sādo), another technique, uses air in his bones to attack but makes him shrink afterward. Luffy can use both techniques simultaneously; after two years, he gains better control of the techniques and is no longer affected by their drawbacks.</p>


                <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/luffy-haki.jpg" alt="Haki" style="float:left;width:602px;height:338px;padding:10px;"><p style="font-size:160%;">Eventually, Luffy develops his latent ability to use Haki (覇気, ambition). This ability has two main types: Armament Haki (武装色の覇気, Busōshoku no Haki), an armor-like force, which can amplify defense and the force of attacks as well as negate a Devil Fruit user's defenses, allowing physical contact and damage, lastly there is Observation Haki (見聞色の覇気, Kenbunshoku no Haki), a sixth sense, which can read a person's moves and detect their presence. He also has a rare third type called, the Conquering King's Haki (覇王色の覇気, Haōshoku no Haki), which can cause weak-willed people or animals near him to become unconscious.</p>

                <p style="font-size:160%;">Two years later, Luffy learns the basic three types of Haki and uses them with his improved attacks. As a result of his encounter with Magellan, he has also developed an immunity to poison (although it is shown that a strong poison may affect him, albeit very slowly). During his fight against Charlotte Katakuri, Luffy's Observation Haki gains the ability to see several seconds into the future. During his time at Udon prison in Wano, Luffy's Armament Haki gains the ability to shoot a short blast of Haki from a distance, which can also go inside his target's body or a objects body and destroy it from within. During his fight with Kaido at the top of Onigashima, Luffy's Haoshoku Haki gains the ability to coat his entire body with it, similar to Busoshoku Haki, which could further enhance his attacks.</p>

                <p style="font-size:160%;">Luffy develops another technique, Fourth Gear (ギア4フォース, Gia Fōsu) (similar to Third Gear), inflating his muscles to increase the size of his limbs (except for his legs). He can make destructive moves by compressing and releasing his limbs, and can fly in a similar fashion to CP9's Moon Walk (月歩, Geppō) technique.</p>




                <strong><h1 class="pb-4 mb-4 fst-italic border-bottom">Bounty Raises & Events </h1></strong>

                <p style="font-size:160%;"><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/81/5f/34/815f34de0cec312dd9960e5c08c65b1d.jpg" alt="Bounty" style="float:left;width:602px;height:338px;padding:10px;">Luffy's first bounty is 30,000,000 Berries, which he receives after defeating Buggy, Don Krieg, and Arlong of East Blue. His second bounty is significantly higher, at 100,000,000 Berries, after defeating Crocodile of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Luffy receives his third bounty of 300,000,000 Berries, after rampaging the Enies Lobby and retaking Nico Robin.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size:160%;">His subsequent bounty of 400,000,000 Berries, is mainly given to him because of his defeat of another Warlord of the Sea, Gecko Moria, and his participation in the Summit War of Marineford. After the time-skip, Luffy grows more powerful and receives a bounty of 500,000,000 Berries, after defeating a third Warlord, Donquixote Doflamingo. After defeating Charlotte Cracker and Charlotte Katakuri, two of the Big Mom Pirate's top ranking members, with bounties of 800,000,000 and 1,057,000,000 Berries respectively, and having gone against Big Mom herself, one of the Four Emperors of the sea, he received his current bounty of 1,500,000,000 Berries, one of the highest known bounties in the Straw Hat crew.</p>
