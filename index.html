  <p>Monkey D. Luffy (Japanese: モンキー・D・ルフィ), also known as "Straw Hat" Luffy, is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the One Piece manga series, created by Eiichiro Oda. Luffy made his debut in One Piece Chapter #1 as a young boy who acquires the properties of rubber after accidentally eating the supernatural Gum-Gum Fruit, one of the Devil Fruits.</p>
      
      <br>

<p>Luffy dreamt of being a pirate since childhood from the influence of "Red-Haired" Shanks. At the age of 17, Luffy sets sail from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece, to succeed Gol D. Roger as "King of the Pirates". Luffy, captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, recruits crew members Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, Tony Tony Chopper, Nico Robin, Franky, Brook, and Jimbei. He fights antagonists, and aids and befriends the inhabitants of several islands on his journey. Usually cheerful, he becomes serious and even aggressive when he fights. Luffy uses his elasticity to concentrate his power, executing a range of attacks. In his signature attack, Gum-Gum Pistol, he slingshots punches at opponents from a distance. Luffy also grows stronger over the course of the story, as reflected in his "bounty", which is used to measure the threat he poses to the World Government. He is the grandson of Monkey D. Garp, who is a vice-admiral; and the son of Monkey D. Dragon, who is the leader of the Revolutionary Army, but was raised by his foster mother, Curly Dadan, who is the leader of mountain bandits, meeting his adopted brothers, Portgas D. Ace and Sabo, in their childhood.</p>
